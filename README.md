# ELMo-Embedding

We tested ELMo embedding on the Kaggle Challenge: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews. The dataset is available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/.

Although the challenge was closed 4 years ago, it is interesting to apply a state-of-the-art algorithm on a previous challenge to compare the results.

ELMo embedding method is detailed on the following article: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365.

To get the submission.csv in Kaggle format, just run main.py.
